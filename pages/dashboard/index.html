                <div id='break2'></div>
                <p>Stocket is a lightweight finance API designed to provide quick and easy access to stock market data.
                    We use an Node.js server connected to an SQL database, and update the database every minute through
                    a separate application to avoid clogging the main web server. Our main implementation, PyStocket
                    (<a>link</a>) can be installed as a Python package. Please view the documentation on the GitHub, 
                    and review the usage parameters before using. Improper use could result in a deactivation of your token.
                    <br><br>
                    Stocket is not meant to be the fastest or most expansive API, but aims to provide beginners with a simple
                    source of stock market data down to per minute increments, so that anybody interested in quantitative
                    finance can easily get started with comprehensible data.
                    <br><br>
                    Stocket is very early in development, but a working version has been established. Please bear with us on 
                    any bug fixes or design changes that need to happen.
                    <br><br>
                    Lastly, please remember that this API updates itself, and only has data back until the API conception in
                    September of 2020. In the Python package, we can provide end of day (EOD) data from quite a while ago using 
                    another API, but our minute data only dates back to September of 2020.
                    <br><br>
                    Thank you, and happy trading!
